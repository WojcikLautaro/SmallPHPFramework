# SmallPHPFramework
This is a lightweight PHP routing and middleware framework built from scratch as part of my portfolio. It features:

- Route handling with middleware support
- Pre/post middleware chaining
- Basic controller dispatch pattern
- Response abstraction (JSON, view rendering, redirects)
- Minimal and clean architecture
